Here are the steps to change to PERFORMANCE mode from the default POWERSAVE mode on Ubuntu 18.04:

First run, 
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor

If it shows “PERFORMANCE” then you’re good. Otherwise, if it shows “POWERSAVE” follow the steps below:

Step 1: Install Packages:
                sudo apt update
      sudo apt install cpufrequtils

Step 2: Edit the config file:
                In the command line, type:
                sudo nano /etc/default/cpufrequtils

                This will open an editor, in which add

                GOVERNOR=”performance”

                Press “Ctrl + O” to save and hit Enter. And then press “Ctrl + X” to exit.

Step 3: Enable and start the service:
                sudo systemctl enable cpufrequtils
      sudo systemctl start cpufrequtils

                Alternatively, you can also restart by using:
                sudo systemctl restart cpufrequtils

Now re-run the command:  cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor


You will see that it has changed to “PERFORMANCE”.

Now to keep this permanent, type the following in Command Prompt:
                sudo systemctl disable ondemand
      sudo systemctl stop ondemand

Doing this will prevent the machine from reverting back to its original POWERSAVE setting.

Following the steps listed above will significantly increase performance and utilizes CPU properly.
